# TRON-Tokens-Bulk-Sender
Python script which can be used for bulk sending (aka TRC airdrop). This version only supports airdropping TRC10 tokens to other TRC10 tokens holders.

<br><p><h1>Disclaimer:</h1></p><br>

You should run this script in your IDE because the wallet's PK will be exposed. I suggest to create a new wallet to make the airdrop from. Also, You need to fund your wallet with a few TRX which will be consumed (burned) by the network as bandwidth, otherwise, an error will throw. <br> TRC20 support is coming soon !
